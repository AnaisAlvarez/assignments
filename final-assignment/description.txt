Final Assignment: Small Website
A brief text description of site.

This website serves as an online portfolio with the following pages:
Home, Background, Projects, Inspiration, and Contact. Though the pages have
not yet been filled with content, they serve as a template for current and 
future professional work so that it may be easily displayed to potential 
employers. The Home page has a profile image and an "About Me" section.
The Background page has a timeline that can be used to show significant 
achievements and/or employment/academic history. The Projects page is meant 
to showcase prior projects - there are placeholders for an image and
a short description of the project. The Inspirations page has lists of
resources, such as books and podcasts, that have influenced projects,
work ethics, design skills etc. The Contact page has a form displayed
- at this point this is only a placeholder - where site visitors can 
submit a message. Finally, the Footer - visible on each of the five pages -
has links to my resume and other social media pages. I hope to use this
website as my UX portfolio, and will be adding content to the HTML.
